=head1 SYNOPSIS

In dist.ini:

    [@Author::RTHOMPSON]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin bundle, in its default configuration, is equivalent to:

    [AutoVersion]
    major = 0
    [GatherDir]
    [PruneCruft]
    [ManifestSkip]
    [MetaYAML]
    [MetaJSON]
    [MetaNoIndex]
    dir = corpus
    [License]
    [ExecDir]
    [ShareDir]
    [MakeMaker]
    [Manifest]
    [PkgVersion]
    [PodWeaver]
    [InstallGuide]
    [ReadmeAnyFromPod / ReadmeTextInBuild ]
    [ReadmeAnyFromPod / ReadmePodInRoot ]
    phase = release
    [Test::Perl::Critic]
    [PodCoverageTests]
    [PodSyntaxTests]
    [HasVersionTests]
    [Test::Portability]
    [Test::UnusedVars]
    [Test::Compile]
    skip = Test$
    [Test::Kwalitee]
    [ExtraTests]
    [ReportVersions]
    [MinimumPerl]
    [AutoPrereqs]
    [CheckChangesHasContent]
    [CheckPrereqsIndexed]
    [CheckVersionIncrement]
    [NextRelease]
    [TestRelease]
    [ConfirmRelease]
    [UploadToCPAN]
    [ArchiveRelease]
    directory = releases
    [Git::Check]
    allow_dirty = dist.ini
    allow_dirty = README.pod
    allow_dirty = Changes
    [Git::Commit]
    allow_dirty = dist.ini
    allow_dirty = README.pod
    allow_dirty = Changes
    [Git::Tag]
    [Git::Push]
    push_to = origin
    [Git::Remote::Check]
    remote_name = origin
    branch = master
    remote_branch = master
    [GithubMeta]

There are several options that can change the default configuation,
though.

=option -remove

This option can be used to remove specific plugins from the bundle. It
can be used multiple times.

Obviously, the default is not to remove any plugins.

Example:

    ; Remove these two plugins from the bundle
    -remove = Test::Perl::Critic
    -remove = GithubMeta

=option version, version_major

This option is used to specify the version of the module. The default
is 'auto', which uses the AutoVersion plugin to choose a version
number. You can also set the version number manually, or choose
'disable' to prevent this bundle from supplying a version.

Examples:

    ; Use AutoVersion (default)
    version = auto
    version_major = 0
    ; Use manual versioning
    version = 1.14.04
    ; Provide no version, so that another plugin can handle it.
    version = disable

=option copy_file, move_file

If you want to copy or move files out of the build dir and into the
distribution dir, use these two options to specify those files. Both
of these options can be specified multiple times.

The most common reason to use this would be to put automatically
generated files under version control. For example, Github likes to
see a README file in your distribution, but if your README file is
auto-generated during the build, you need to copy each newly-generated
README file out of its build directory in order for Github to see it.

If you want to include an auto-generated file in your distribution but
you I<don't> want to include it in the build, use C<move_file> instead
of C<copy_file>.

By default, both of these options are unset.

Example:

    copy_file = README
    move_file = README.pod
    copy_file = README.txt

=option synopsis_is_perl_code

If this is set to true (the default), then the SynopsisTests plugin
will be enabled. This plugin checks the perl syntax of the SYNOPSIS
sections of your modules. Obviously, if your SYNOPSIS section is not
perl code (case in point: this module), you should set this to false.

Example:

    synopsis_is_perl_code = false

=option release

This option chooses the type of release to do. The default is 'real,'
which means "really upload the release to CPAN" (i.e. load the
C<UploadToCPAN> plugin). You can set it to 'fake,' in which case the
C<FakeRelease> plugin will be loaded, which simulates the release
process without actually doing anything. You can also set it to 'none'
if you do not want this module to load any release plugin, in which
case your F<dist.ini> file should load a release plugin directly. Any
other value for this option will be interpreted as a release plugin
name to be loaded.

Examples:

    ; Release to CPAN for real (default)
    release = real
    ; For testing, you can do fake releases
    release = fake
    ; Or you can choose no release plugin
    release = none
    ; Or you can specify a specific release plugin.
    release = OtherReleasePlugin

=option archive, archive_directory

If set to true, the C<archive> option copies each released version of
the module to an archive directory, using the C<ArchiveRelease>
plugin. This is the default. The name of the archive directory is
specified using C<archive_directory>, which is F<releases> by default.

Examples:

    ; archive each release to the "releases" directory
    archive = true
    archive_directory = releases
    ; Or don't archive
    archive = false

=option vcs

This option specifies which version control system is being used for
the distribution. Integration for that version control system is
enabled. The default is 'git', and currently the only other option is
'none', which does not load any version control plugins.

=option git_remote

This option specifies the primary Git remote for the repository. The
default is 'origin'. To disable all Git remote operations, set this to
an empty string.

=option git_branch, git_remote_branch

This option specifies the branch that is to be checked against its
remote. The default is 'master'. The second option,
C<git_remote_branch>, is only needed if the remote branch has a
different name. It will default to being the same as C<git_branch>.

=option no_check_remote

By default, the Git branch C<git_branch> will be checked against the
remote branch C<git_remote_branch> at the remote specified by
C<git_remote> using the C<Git::Remote::Check> plugin. If the remote
branch is ahead of the local branch, the release process will be
aborted. This option disables the check, allowing a release to happen
even if the check would fail. This option has no effect if either
C<git_remote> or C<git_branch> is set to an empty string.

=option no_push

By default, the Git repo will be pushed to the remote specified by
C<git_remote> after every release, to ensure that the remote
repository contains the latest release. To disable pushing after a
release, set this option. This option has no effect if git_remote is
set to an empty string.

=option allow_dirty

This corresponds to the option of the same name in the Git::Check and
Git::Commit plugins. Briefly, files listed in C<allow_dirty> are
allowed to have changes that are not yet committed to git, and during
the release process, they will be checked in (committed).

The default is F<dist.ini>, F<Changes>, and F<README.pod>. If you
override the default, you must include these files manually if you
want them.

This option only has an effect if C<vcs> is 'git'.

=option PLUGIN-SPECIFIC OPTIONS

This bundle consumes the
C<Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer> role, which means
that you can specify any option to any plugin in the bundle directly
by prefixing it with the plugin's name. This allows you to configure
any options not covered by the above. For example, if you want to
select "scripts" as the directory for the ExecDir plugin, you would
specify the option as C<ExecDir.dir = "scripts">.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This module should be more configurable. Suggestions welcome.
